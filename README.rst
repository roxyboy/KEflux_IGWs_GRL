Data for "On the modulation of kinetic energy flux by internal gravity waves"
=============================================================================

|DOI|

This is a data repository for the twin eNATL60 data used for: `On the modulation
of kinetic energy flux by internal gravity waves <https://github.com/roxyboy/KEflux_IGWs_GRL>`_. *Geophys. Res. Let.*, 2022.

The sea-surface `zonal <https://ige-meom-opendap.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/thredds/catalog/meomopendap/extract/eNATL60/eNATL60-BLBT02/surf/catalog.html>`_ and `meridional <https://ige-meom-opendap.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/thredds/catalog/meomopendap/extract/eNATL60/eNATL60-BLB002/surf/catalog.html>`_ velocity data are available publicly via OPeNDAP.

The three-dimensional (3D) data are permanently stored on the CINES supercomputing center in Montpellier, France.
The regional 3D data used for this study are over 10Tb and will be available upon request.
