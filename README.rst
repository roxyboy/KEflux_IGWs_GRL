Data for "On the modulation of kinetic energy flux by internal gravity waves"
=============================================================================

|DOI|

This is a data repository for the twin eNATL60 data used for: `On the modulation
of kinetic energy flux by internal gravity waves <https://github.com/roxyboy/KEflux_IGWs_GRL>`_. *Geophys. Res. Let.*, 2022.

The sea-surface data for the runs `with (eN60-WT) <https://ige-meom-opendap.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/thredds/catalog/meomopendap/extract/eNATL60/eNATL60-BLBT02/surf/catalog.html>`_ and `without tidal forcing (eN60-NT) <https://ige-meom-opendap.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/thredds/catalog/meomopendap/extract/eNATL60/eNATL60-BLB002/surf/catalog.html>`_ are available publicly via OPeNDAP.

The three-dimensional (3D) data are permanently stored on the CINES supercomputing center in Montpellier, France.
The regional 3D data used for this study are over 10Tb and will be available upon request.
Please contact us by raising an `issue <https://github.com/roxyboy/KEflux_IGWs_GRL/issues>`_ on Github.

Further details on the model configuration and preliminary assessment of the
eNATL60 runs can be found `here <https://zenodo.org/record/4032732>`_.
